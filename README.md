# DirectionalNK

N-K Models [1] are used in simulating biological systems. This project simulates the evolutionary behavior of a viral system using an N-K model where the system is given environmental shocks of varying degree.

The repository contains a self-contained project that can be imported into Eclipse (Juno). The main program is Simulation.java. Inputs can be given as described in resources/input.txt.
